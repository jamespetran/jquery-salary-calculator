# Project Name

jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

- The deployed version of this little site can be found [here](https://jpetran2.github.io/jquery-salary-calculator/)

- This project ingests employee data. It uses a form to gather first name, last name, ID number, job title and the employee's annual salary. 

- When the user submits this information, it is displayed on a table along with the rest of the data previously entered.

- If the user wants to delete a previously entered employee, they simply click the delete button on the right side. 

- The bottom of the page features a monthly cost counter. Keep in mind that the salary entered in is the annual amount, so a bit of calculation must be done to determine the monthly amount. If this monthly amount goes over $20,000 it turns red. When the monthly amount goes under 20k, it stops being red.

## Technical Details

- This code runs in javascript and is entirely clientside. It is a simple proof of concept, so no data is stored on any servers or anything. It will not keep its data if the page is reloaded.

- I used jQuery to make the changes to the DOM and to give functionality to the inputs and buttons. I have used bootstrap to style the page a bit better than an ugly html mess.

- All javascript was written by me. I got a little bit of css styling from stackoverflow to make my footer stick to the bottom, and I linked the source in the css file.

## About Me

- I am a student at Prime Academy in Minneapolis, MN. I started this course on a part-time remote basis in October 2021, and started full time in-person classes on December 6, 2021. Today is December 11, 2021, so I've been learning javascript for a short time. This is my first large project I've ever made. I am sure I will look back on this someday and cringe but right now I feel satisfied with my efforts. It works according to the project instructions, and I didn't really struggle with anything. I understand that we will learn React soon which will put jQuery to shame, but this was still fun.
